    <!-- Detailed Reviews for 7 Selected Products -->
    <h2>1. Simple Green Oxy Solve Total Outdoor Pressure Washer Cleaner</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81kwWqp0FrL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="Simple Green Oxy Solve Total Outdoor Pressure Washer Cleaner">
    <p>This is a top-tier, versatile detergent from a trusted brand, formulated specifically for pressure washers and designed for all outdoor surfaces. Its oxygen-powered formula actively breaks down organic materials like algae, lichen, and tree sap without harsh chemicals that could harm landscaping or pets. It's highly concentrated, meaning a little goes a long way, offering excellent value. Users consistently praise its ability to restore dingy vinyl and wood siding to a near-new appearance with minimal scrubbing.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Safe for all exterior surfaces including decks and fences, excellent on organic stains, biodegradable and non-corrosive, very high user satisfaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> May require a second application on years of built-up grime; stronger chemical smells than some unscented options.</p>

    <h2>2. Oxy Solve House and Siding Pressure Washer Cleaner</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ef-tIv7gL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="Oxy Solve House and Siding Pressure Washer Cleaner">
    <p>As the name implies, this product is laser-focused on the primary challenge of house washing: mold, mildew, and the stubborn stains they leave on vinyl, aluminum, and wood. Its formula is potent against fungal growth but still safe for most painted surfaces when used correctly. It's another oxygen-based cleaner, which means it works while you wet it and rinses away cleanly without leaving a hazy residue. This is an outstanding choice for homes in humid climates or with significant shaded areas where mildew thrives.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> exceptional on mold & mildew, designed for house-specific surfaces, biodegradable, excellent value per use.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Less effective on non-organic greases or automotive fluids; may need a pre-soak for extreme cases.</p>

    <h2>3. Simpson Cleaning 88282 Concentrated Soap Solution</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71jPReX0F4L._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="Simpson Cleaning 88282 Concentrated Soap Solution">
    <p>Simpson is a major name in pressure washers, and this detergent is engineered to work perfectly with their machines but is universally compatible. It's a versatile, all-purpose concentrate that excels on general dirt, pollen, and light grime on a vast array of surfaces: siding, decks, fences, cars, and outdoor furniture. Its formula is gentle yet effective, making it a safe bet for homeowners who want one cleaner for multiple tasks. It produces good foam and rinses cleanly, preventing spots.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely versatile (home, auto, patio), safe for delicate surfaces like vehicles, excellent foaming, great for routine maintenance cleaning.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not as powerful on tough, set-in organic stains or heavy industrial grime; may require higher dilution for very soiled areas.</p>

    <h2>4. Simple Green Pro HD Heavy Duty Cleaner Concentrate</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Rn+yFOfYL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="Simple Green Pro HD Heavy Duty Cleaner Concentrate">
    <p>This is Simple Green's powerhouse. While not exclusively marketed for pressure washers, its industrial-strength degreasing formula makes it a formidable option for houses with severe greasy buildup (e.g., from a nearby road or grill exhaust). It's a non-acid, non-caustic cleaner that can tackle everything from engine grease to bird droppings. <strong>Important:</strong> Due to its strength, it's crucial to test on an inconspicuous area first and adhere strictly to dilution ratios to avoid potential damage to sensitive finishes like some stained wood or anodized aluminum.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unmatched power on greasy, oily stains, extremely versatile for workshop and garage use, non-acid formula, highly concentrated.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Overkill for routine cleaning; requires careful testing and dilution to avoid surface damage; not specifically tailored for mildew.</p>

    <h2>5. RMR-86 Pro Contractor Grade Mold Stain & Mildew Stain Remover</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jgV421XCL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="RMR-86 Pro Contractor Grade Mold Stain & Mildew Stain Remover">
    <p>RMR-86 occupies a specialized niche. It's not a general "wash" detergent; it's a potent stain remover designed to kill and obliterate the dark, ugly stains left by mold and mildew, even after the living organism is gone. It works without scrubbing on contact. For houses where black streaks on north-facing siding or roof edges are the primary problem, this is arguably the best tool for the job. It's typically used as a pre-treatment before a general wash with another detergent.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> The most powerful option for eliminating existing mold/mildew stains, works rapidly, no scrubbing needed for many stains.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Harsh chemical smell, requires careful use with PPE (gloves, eye protection), not a routine cleaner, can be discoloring if misapplied.</p>

    <h2>6. ZEP INC House/Siding Wash</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51m3c1CzXIL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="ZEP INC 128OZ House/Siding Wash">
    <p>ZEP is a longstanding name in professional-grade maintenance chemicals. Their House/Siding Wash is a balanced, biodegradable formula designed to clean and brighten exterior surfaces. It's effective on common outdoor contaminants like dirt, pollen, and light environmental staining. It's a reliable, no-fuss option that gets the job done. While it may not have the specialized power of some others for extreme organic growth, it performs consistently well for seasonal cleaning and is trusted by many homeowners and pros alike.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Trusted professional brand, good all-around performance, biodegradable, generally safe for most surfaces, good foaming.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> May struggle with heavy, set-in mildew without pre-treatment; user experience can vary slightly by water pressure and dilution.</p>

    <h2>7. Simple Green Oxy Solve Concrete and Driveway Pressure Washer Cleaner</h2>
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sD+RPmEPL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="Simple Green Oxy Solve Concrete and Driveway Pressure Washer Cleaner">
    <p>While primarily for concrete, this is a crucial inclusion because your home's "house" exterior includes the driveway, walkways, and patios. This formula is optimized for porous, non-porous hardscapes, attacking oil stains, tire marks, and embedded dirt that a general house detergent might not fully handle. Its oxygen-based action is safe for the environment and won't harm nearby landscaping. For a complete exterior clean, pairing this with a dedicated siding cleaner is the pro strategy.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent on concrete/brick/stone, great for oil and ground-in dirt, safe for plants, no harsh acids.</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Formulated for hardscapes; may be less effective or economical on vertical siding surfaces; not the best first choice for painted or wooden house surfaces.</p>

    <h2>Buying Guide: How to Choose the Right Detergent for Your House</h2>
    <p>Selecting the best detergent goes beyond just brand or rating. Consider these key factors for your specific project:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface Material:</strong> This is paramount. Vinyl and aluminum siding are generally robust. Wood requires gentler, pH-neutral cleaners to avoid stripping finishes or raising fibers. Stucco and brick can handle stronger formulas but are porous, requiring good rinsing. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations for your siding.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Soiling Type:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Dirt & Pollen:</strong> A versatile all-purpose cleaner like the Simpson or ZEP is perfect.</li>
                <li><strong>Organic Growth (Mildew/Algae/Lichen):</strong> Seek oxygen-based formulas (often labeled "Oxy Solve" or similar). Simple Green's Total Outdoor or House & Siding versions are top picks here.</li>
                <li><strong>Grease/Oil Stains:</strong> Near a road or have a grill exhaust? A heavy-duty degreaser like Simple Green Pro HD is necessary, but use with caution and proper dilution.</li>
                <li><strong>Set-In Mold Stains:</strong> The black streaks? Use a dedicated stain remover like RMR-86 as a pre-treatment before washing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Concentration & Value:</strong> All products here are concentrates. Check the dilution ratio. A 1:10 ratio is common. A larger, more concentrated bottle offers better long-term value. Calculate the cost per cleaning session.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental & Plant Safety:</strong> Biodegradable formulas are better for your garden and local waterways. Oxygen-based cleaners are typically more eco-friendly than chlorine or heavy solvents. Keep any detergent off desirable plants by wetting them first and rinsing after cleaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Ensure the detergent is safe for your pressure washer's pump (most modern concentrates are). Some "detergent" packages for big-box store washers are low-quality; professional-grade concentrates are always a better choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The "best" pressure washer detergent for your house ultimately depends on your home's specific challenges. For most homeowners seeking a reliable, effective, and safe all-around solution for siding and general outdoor surfaces, the <strong>Simple Green Oxy Solve Total Outdoor</strong> is our top recommendation due to its superb balance of power, safety, and versatility.</p>
    
    <p>If mold and mildew are your sole nemesis, the <strong>Oxy Solve House and Siding</strong> formula is your specialized weapon.
