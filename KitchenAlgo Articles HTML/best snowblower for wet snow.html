    <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Buying Guide: Key Features for Wet Snow</h2>
        <p>Wet snow demands more from a machine than dry, fluffy snow. Focus on these critical features:</p>
        <div class="key-point"><strong>1. Auger Design & Material:</strong> Look for a sturdy, aggressive auger. Steel augers are the most durable for scraping packed, wet snow off surfaces. Some high-end plastic augers are also effective, but avoid flimsy designs. A wider auger (16"+ for single-hand shovels, 20"+ for larger units) removes more snow per pass, which is vital for wet, heavy loads.</div>
        <div class="key-point"><strong>2. Throwing Distance:</strong> Wet snow is dense and doesn't fly far. A minimum throw distance of 15-20 feet is recommended. This allows you to cast the slush well away from your cleared area, preventing it from melting and refreezing into ice or sliding back onto your driveway. Models claiming 25ft+ have a clear advantage.</div>
        <div class="key-point"><strong>3. Power Source & Motor Type:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Corded (120V):</strong> Offers unlimited runtime and maximum consistent torque. Ideal for medium-sized areas near an outlet. Best pure power for wet snow.</li>
                <li><strong>Cordless (V-Battery):</strong> Offers freedom of movement. Voltage (20V, 24V, 40V) correlates with power potential. <strong>Brushless Motors</strong> are superior for wet snow—they are more efficient, produce more torque per watt, and run cooler, preventing thermal slowdown when tackling heavy slush.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Capacity (Ah):</strong> Higher Amp-hours (e.g., 4.0Ah, 5.0Ah) mean longer runtime. For wet snow, which drains batteries faster, prioritize larger capacity batteries or models with dual-battery systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="key-point"><strong>4. Clearing Width & Capacity:</strong> Width (in inches) determines how many passes you'll need. For a single-car driveway, 16-20 inches is manageable. For longer drives, 20+ inches cuts time. Pay attention to the "lbs/minute" or "tons/hour" clearing rate—higher numbers mean better handling of wet, heavy snow.</div>
        <div class="key-point"><strong>5. Weight & Maneuverability:</strong> Wet snow is heavy, and so is the machine clearing it. A very heavy unit can be exhausting to push. Look for a balance between power (often heavier) and manageable weight (under 30 lbs for single-hand shovels is ideal). Models with wheels offer a major advantage for reducing push effort on large, flat areas.</div>
