    </div>
    <p>This concentrate features the powerful active ingredient 2,4-D amine, a gold-standard selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds like clover. It’s a professional-grade formula that offers excellent control on tough, established clover without damaging most cool-season and warm-season grasses when used correctly.

    </div>
    <p>This product combines a non-selective herbicide (glyphosate) to kill existing weeds, including clover, with a pre-emergent to prevent new weeds for up to 12 months. It’s ideal for complete renovation areas, driveways, or patios where you want to clear all vegetation and prevent regrowth. However, <strong>it will kill any grass it contacts</strong>, making it unsuitable for spot-treating clover in a healthy lawn you wish to keep. The comfort wand allows for precise application.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Barricade is a professional-grade pre-emergent herbicide containing dimension, which creates a chemical barrier in the soil to prevent weed seeds from germinating. It’s highly effective against grassy weeds like crabgrass and some broadleaf weeds. However, <strong>it will not kill existing clover</strong>; it only prevents new weeds from establishing. For clover control, it must be used as part of a preventative program in early spring before clover seeds germinate. It covers a large area (up to 5,800 sq. ft.) and is fertilizer-free.</p>

    <p>Ortho GroundClear is a fast-acting, non-selective herbicide designed to kill all vegetation, including clover, dandelions, crabgrass, and moss, on contact. It’s OMRI-listed for organic gardening, making it suitable for use in vegetable gardens before planting. However, like all non-selective herbicides, it will also kill your grass.

    </div>
    <p>This is a classic non-selective glyphosate formula in a convenient Pump 'N Go sprayer. It kills clover and most other weeds and grasses by inhibiting an essential plant enzyme. Its primary strength is versatility and reliability for total vegetation control. However, it offers no selectivity; any grass blade it touches will die. The pump sprayer is reusable and easy to handle, making it good for spot treatments on patios, fences, or for clearing small patches before reseeding. For clover in a healthy lawn, this is a last-resort option if you’re willing to sacrifice the grass.</p>

    <h2>Buying Guide: How to Choose the Right Clover Killer for Your Lawn</h2>
    <p>Selecting the best clover killer depends on your lawn's condition, your experience with herbicides, and your long-term lawn care goals. Here are the critical factors to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selectivity is Paramount:</strong> For clover in a lawn you want to keep, choose a <strong>selective herbicide</strong> containing active ingredients like 2,4-D, dicamba, MCPP, or quinclorac. These target broadleaf weeds while sparing grass. Non-selective herbicides (glyphosate) will kill your grass alongside the clover.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Look for products with proven broadleaf herbicides. 2,4-D is the most common and effective against clover. Combination products (e.g., 2,4-D + dicamba + MCPP) often provide broader spectrum control. Always check the label for the exact ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Form:</strong> Ready-to-spray (hose-end or spray bottle) is easiest for beginners. Concentrates require mixing but are more economical for large areas. Granular pre-emergents are spread with a fertilizer spreader and are for prevention only.</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage and Concentration:</strong> Ensure the product size matches your lawn area. Concentrates like Southern Ag offer high coverage per ounce but need proper mixing. Granular products cover large square footages but require watering in.</li>
        <li><strong>Timing and Weather:</strong> Apply selective herbicides when weeds are actively growing (typically spring or fall, temperatures between 60-80°F). Avoid application in extreme heat or rain forecast within 24 hours. Pre-emergents must be applied before weed seeds germinate (early spring).</li>
        <li><strong>Lawn Type and Safety:</strong> Verify the product is safe for your specific grass (e.g., Bermuda, Kentucky bluegrass, St. Augustine). Some herbicides can injure certain grasses. Always follow label instructions regarding waiting periods after seeding or sodding.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Approach:</strong> For severe clover problems, combine a post-emergent (to kill existing clover) with a pre-emergent (to prevent new seeds) and proper lawn maintenance (mowing high, proper fertilization, aeration) to outcompete weeds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Winning the war against clover in your lawn hinges on using the right tool for the job. For most homeowners with existing clover patches, a selective herbicide is the only safe choice. <strong>Scotts Turf Builder Weed & Feed3</strong> offers the best balance of effectiveness, lawn nourishment, and ease of use. For a pure, no-frills spray, <strong>Ortho WeedClear Lawn</strong> is a reliable ready-to-use option. If you’re facing a heavy, mature clover infestation and are comfortable mixing concentrates, <strong>Southern Ag Amine 2,4-D</strong> delivers professional-grade power.</p>
    <p>Remember, prevention is just as important as elimination. Consider incorporating a pre-emergent like <strong>Andersons Barricade</strong> into your spring lawn care routine to stop new clover seeds from sprouting. Avoid non-selective products like Roundup Dual Action 365 or Ortho GroundClear for spot treatments in lawns you wish to keep—they are strictly for total vegetation control in non-turf areas or renovation projects.</p>
    <p>Always read and follow the product label, wear protective gear during application, and consider a spot test on a small area if using a new herbicide. With the right product and proper lawn care, you can achieve a clover-free, lush green lawn.</p>
