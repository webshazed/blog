    <h2>Buying Guide: What to Look for in a Budget Car Amplifier</h2>
    <p>Don't be fooled by "peak" power ratings. Focus on <strong>RMS (Root Mean Square) power</strong> at specific impedances (like 4 ohms or 2 ohms). RMS is the continuous, usable power. Also consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Amplifier Class:</strong> All our picks are Class-D, which is far more efficient (less heat, less draw on your car's electrical system) than older Class-AB, making it ideal for budget setups.</li>
        <li><strong>Channels:</strong> Choose a 4-channel for full speaker systems (4 doors). A monoblock (1-channel) is for subwoofers only. Some 5-channel amps exist but are less common in the true budget tier.</li>
        <li><strong>Impedance Stability:</strong> Ensure the amp is stable at the impedance (ohms) of your speaker(s). 2-ohm stable per channel is common and good for maximum power. 1-ohm stable monoblocks can power very low-impedance subs.</li>
        <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Look for both RCA (for aftermarket stereos) and high-level/speaker-level inputs (for factory stereos). This is a major convenience feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Crossover:</strong> A high-pass filter protects your speakers from low frequencies. A low-pass filter is essential for a subwoofer. Variable crossovers offer more tuning flexibility than fixed ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Size & Installation:</strong> Check the dimensions against your available space (under a seat, in the trunk). Smaller "compact" amps are great for stealth installations.</li>
        <li><strong>Wiring Kit:</strong> Budget amps often don't include a complete wiring kit. You'll need proper gauge power (usually 4-gauge or 8-gauge), ground, speaker, and RCA cables. The included product (#10) is a great example of a necessary accessory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The budget car amplifier market in 2026 is fantastic, offering incredible performance for the price. Our top recommendation for most people is the <strong>Taramps TS 400x4</strong> for its perfect balance of proven reliability, solid power, and essential features. If your focus is solely on bass, the <strong>ZE1000.1</strong> monoblock provides exceptional power-per-dollar in a compact package.</p>
    <p>Remember to match your amplifier's power to your speakers' or subwoofer's RMS ratings, providing a little headroom. Invest in a proper wiring kit and ensure your vehicle's electrical system is healthy. With any of these amplifiers, you can achieve a dramatic and satisfying audio upgrade without the premium cost.</p>
