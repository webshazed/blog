<h2>Buying Guide: What to Look For in a Budget 4-Channel Amp</h2>
<p>Choosing the right amplifier hinges on understanding a few key specifications. Here’s what matters most when shopping on a budget:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>RMS vs. Peak Power:</strong> Ignore the exaggerated "Max" or "Peak" numbers. Focus on <strong>RMS (Root Mean Square)</strong> power ratings at a specific impedance (e.g., 4 ohms, 2 ohms). RMS represents continuous, usable power. A 400W RMS amp will sound better and be more reliable than a "1000W Max" amp with only 200W RMS.</li>
  <li><strong>Impedance Stability:</strong> Check the ohm rating (e.g., 2-ohms stable, 1-ohm stable). An amp stable at 2 ohms can safely power most 4-ohm speakers. An amp stable at 1 ohm can deliver maximum power to a subwoofer wired to 1 ohm.</li>
  <li><strong>Class (D vs. A/B):</strong> <strong>Class D</strong> is more efficient, runs cooler, and is smaller—ideal for modern, high-power budget amps. <strong>Class A/B</strong> is less efficient but often praised for a "warmer," more musical sound signature at lower volumes. For pure power efficiency in a budget amp, Class D is usually the winner.</li>
  <li><strong>Crossover:</strong> A full-range crossover (high-pass for speakers, low-pass for subs) is essential. It allows you to filter frequencies, protecting your speakers and improving sound quality. Ensure it's adjustable.</li>
  <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Look for both <strong>RCA</strong> (for aftermarket head units) and <strong>high-level ( speaker-level)</strong> inputs. High-level inputs are crucial for integrating with factory stereos that lack pre-amp outputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Physical Size & Installation:</strong> Measure your available space. Compact "mini" amps are great for tight spots but may have lower power. Ensure you have adequate ventilation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The best budget 4-channel amplifier for you depends entirely on your specific power needs and vehicle constraints. For a no-compromise, high-power build, the <strong>Taramps TS 1200x4</strong> or <strong>Skar Audio RP-150.4AB</strong> (if you prefer Class A/B sound) are excellent. For the ultimate balance of power, features, and value, the <strong>Taramps TS 800x4</strong> is a top-tier recommendation. If you're working with a very tight budget or small space, the <strong>Taramps TS 400x4</strong> or <strong>Timpano TPT-500.4</strong> deliver impressive performance without breaking the bank or taking up room.</p>

<p>All the amplifiers on this list have been vetted for their combination of real-world performance, user satisfaction, and affordability. Be sure to match your chosen amp's RMS power to your speakers' handling capabilities for the best, cleanest sound. Happy listening!</p>
