    <h2>Buying Guide: What to Look for in a Construction Lunch Box</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right lunch box for construction work involves weighing several key factors. Here’s what to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insulation Performance:</strong> Look for thick, closed-cell foam or similar high-quality insulation. This determines how long food stays cold (or hot). For 10+ hour shifts, aim for models rated to keep ice for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Construction sites are rough. Prioritize abrasion-resistant fabrics (like polyester or nylon with PU coating), reinforced stitching, and waterproof or water-resistant bases. A hard-shell option can offer extra protection against crushing.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Match the size to your needs. A 10-15L bag holds 10-20 cans plus food, suitable for one person's full-day meals. For crews or huge appetites, 20L+ may be necessary. Compact 4-6L options are for light snacks or short breaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> A padded, adjustable shoulder strap is essential for hands-free carry. Grab handles are useful for quick lifts. Consider weight when empty—some heavy-duty materials add unnecessary bulk.</li>
        <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Exterior pockets for utensils, phones, and tools are handy. Interior compartments or removable dividers help separate hot and cold items. A lid that doubles as a tray or cutting board is a bonus.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Cleaning:</strong> Look for wipeable, odor-resistant linings. Some models have removable liners or are dishwasher-safe (though less common). Avoid fabrics that stain easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Leakproofing:</strong> Seam sealing and a waterproof base prevent spills in your truck or toolbag. Test this by filling with ice and checking for condensation leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Price vs. Value:</strong> You often get what you pay for. Premium brands like Carhartt command higher prices but offer longevity. Mid-range options from Lifewit or HOTOR provide great value. Avoid the cheapest models—they may fail after a few months on site.</li>
    </ul>
