<h3>Nautilus CC Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516n1ZjcLWL._AC_UY218_.jpg" alt="Nautilus CC Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner">
<p>The Nautilus CC is a workhorse in Dolphin's lineup, celebrated for its consistency and value. Designed for pools up to 33 feet, it excels in both above-ground and in-ground setups. Its wall-climbing capability ensures thorough cleaning of vertical surfaces, while the active scrubber brush dislodges stubborn algae and debris. The top-load filter access makes maintenance a breeze—simply rinse the filter cartridge without opening the unit. With over 28,000 reviews, it’s a proven favorite among pool owners.</p>

<h3>(2026 Model) E10 Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IX7lyn73L._AC_UY218_.jpg" alt="(2026 Model) E10 Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner">
<p>The E10 is a 2026 refresh tailored primarily for above-ground pools up to 30 feet. It builds on the Nautilus CC’s strengths with an updated active scrubber brush and retains the convenient top-load filter system. While it shares much of the CC’s DNA, the E10 is optimized for the specific contours and liner materials common in above-ground pools. Its navigation is slightly more agile in smaller, circular setups, making it a solid mid-range choice.</p>

<h3>Premier Robotic Pool Cleaner (2026 Model)</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UDZUcVrdL._AC_UY218_.jpg" alt="Premier Robotic Pool Cleaner (2026 Model)">
<p>Targeting large in-ground pools (up to 50 feet), the Premier model is Dolphin’s powerhouse for extensive cleaning. It boasts a multimedia filtration system that combines standard and ultrafine filters to capture fine dirt and larger leaves. Additional features include an oversized leaf bag and a weekly timer for automated cleaning schedules. However, its larger size and more complex systems result in a heavier unit and a steeper learning curve, reflected in its lower user ratings.</p>

    <div class="pros">
        <h4>Pros</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Capable of handling very large pools (50 ft)</li>

<h3>Proteus DX3 Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51w+ly5NbXL._AC_UY218_.jpg" alt="Proteus DX3 Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner">
<p>The Proteus DX3 is engineered for superior wall-climbing and aggressive scrubbing on in-ground pools up to 33 feet. Its active scrubber brush and robust track system ensure it stays adhered to vertical surfaces, tackling waterline stains effectively. While it lacks some of the smart features of higher-end models, its focused design delivers excellent value for owners with standard in-ground pools who prioritize cleaning power over connectivity.</p>
<div class="pros-cons">
    <div class="pros">
        <h4>Pros</h4>

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zNnqVIx3L._AC_UY218_.jpg" alt="Nautilus CC Supreme Wi-Fi Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner">
<p>The CC Supreme adds smart Wi-Fi connectivity to the trusted Nautilus CC platform, allowing control via smartphone app for pools up to 50 feet. It includes a dedicated waterline scrubber brush and top-load filter access. While the app convenience is a highlight, user reviews indicate the software can be finicky, and the unit’s performance doesn’t significantly outpace the standard CC in cleaning tests. It’s best for tech enthusiasts who value remote control over absolute cleaning efficiency.</p>
<div class="pros-cons">
    <div class="pros">
        <h4>Pros</h4>

<h2>Buying Guide: How to Choose the Right Dolphin Pool Cleaner</h2>
<p>Selecting the ideal Dolphin pool cleaner requires matching the model’s capabilities to your pool’s specific needs. Consider these key factors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pool Size and Type:</strong> Above-ground pools typically require cleaners with gentler navigation and liner-friendly brushes (e.g., E10). In-ground pools, especially larger ones (over 40 ft), benefit from models with enhanced climbing and capacity (e.g., Premier, CC Supreme). Always check the maximum pool length rating.</li>
    <li><strong>Filtration System:</strong> Top-load filter access (Nautilus CC, E10, CC Supreme, Escape) significantly simplifies maintenance. Consider ultrafine filters if you have fine sand or silt, or oversized leaf bags for areas with heavy foliage.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation and Scrubbing:</strong> Basic random navigation is sufficient for simple pool shapes. For complex layouts or waterline stains, prioritize models with advanced scrubbers (Proteus DX3, CC Supreme) and strong track systems (Escape).</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Features:</strong> Wi-Fi and app control (CC Supreme) offer convenience for scheduling and manual operation, but assess whether the premium is justified given potential software hiccups.</li>
    <li><strong>Warranty and Support:</strong> Dolphin typically offers 1-3 year warranties. Longer coverage can be a sign of manufacturer confidence, especially for higher-end models.</li>
    <li><strong>Pool Surface Material:</strong> Vinyl-lined above-ground pools require gentler brushes; concrete or fiberglass in-ground pools can handle more aggressive scrubbing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Dolphin lineup in 2026 offers a cleaner for every scenario, from the unbeatably reliable <strong>Nautilus CC</strong> to the versatile <strong>Escape</strong> and the smart-enabled <strong>CC Supreme</strong>. For most owners with standard pools, the Nautilus CC remains the gold standard for its balance of performance, ease of use, and durability. If you have an above-ground pool, the <strong>E10</strong> is a tailored fit. Large in-ground pool owners should weigh the <strong>Premier</strong> for capacity against the <strong>CC Supreme</strong> for smart features, while those wanting all-around versatility should consider the <strong>Escape</strong>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, align your choice with your pool’s dimensions, your tolerance for maintenance, and desired features.
