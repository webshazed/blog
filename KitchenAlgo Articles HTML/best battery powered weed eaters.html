    <h3>20V 12" Cordless String Trimmer with 2x4.0Ah Batteries</h3>

    <p>This generic-branded 20V trimmer positions itself as a budget-friendly complete kit. The main draw is the inclusion of two 4.0Ah batteries and a charger, which addresses the common pain point of limited runtime. The 12-inch cutting width is adequate for small yards and tight spots. Performance is decent for light to moderate grass and weeds. It’s a straightforward, no-frills option if your primary goal is to get a functional tool with ample spare batteries at a lower cost.</p>

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AhFKBup8L._AC_UY218_.jpg" alt="EGO Power+ String Trimmer, Battery Powered, 15" Trimmer for Weeds and Grass with POWERLOAD, Telescopic Aluminum Shaft, Includes 56V 2.5Ah Battery and Charger - ST1511T">
    <p>This EGO model shares the powerhouse 56V system and POWERLOAD auto-feed magic with its more expensive sibling, but with a slightly more conventional (though still excellent) telescopic aluminum shaft and 15-inch swath. It’s a slightly more affordable entry into EGO’s premium feature set. The aluminum shaft is sturdy and lightweight, and the telescopic adjustment is perfect for getting the ideal length for your height. Performance is stellar, handling everything from grass to thick weeds with ease. It’s the perfect blend of high-end features and a marginally lower price point than the flagship.</p>

    <h2>Buying Guide: What to Look for in 2026</h2>

    <p>Choosing the right battery-powered weed eater isn’t just about brand reputation. Here are the critical factors to consider based on your specific needs:</p>

    <h3>1. Battery Voltage & Ecosystem</h3>
    <p>Voltage (V) generally correlates with power. For most residential use, 20V (or 18V) is sufficient. For heavier, overgrown areas, look at 40V, 56V (like EGO), or 80V platforms. <strong>Ecosystem compatibility is crucial.</strong> If you already own batteries and chargers from a brand like DEWALT, EGO, or CRAFTSMAN, buying a "tool-only" model saves significant money. Investing in a platform means all your batteries work across tools.</p>

    <h3>2. Cutting Swath (Width)</h3>
    <p>Measured in inches, this is how wide a path the trimmer cuts. For small yards (<1/4 acre), 10-12 inches is fine. For medium to large properties (1/4 - 1/2 acre), 14-16 inches will dramatically reduce mowing/trimming time. Wider isn’t always better if the unit becomes too heavy or unwieldy for your body type.</p>

    <h3>3. Weight & Ergonomics</h3>
    <p>You’ll be holding this tool at arm’s length. Check the weight (with battery) and note the shaft design. Straight shafts are better for tall users and undergrowth. Curved shafts are typically lighter and more intuitive for average-height users. Telescopic shafts (like on EGO models) are the ultimate adjustability feature.</p>

    <h3>4. Line Feed System</h3>
    <p><strong>Bump Feed:</strong> You tap the head on the ground to release more line. Traditional, reliable, but you must stop to check/adjust line.<br>
    <strong>Auto Feed:</strong> Line automatically advances as you work (e.g., BLACK+DECKER). More convenient.<br>
    <strong>POWERLOAD/Rapid Reload:</strong> Push a button to feed line instantly (EGO). This is the gold standard for convenience, eliminating all guesswork and stops.</p>

    <h3>5. Runtime & Battery Capacity</h3>
    <p>Battery capacity is measured in Amp-hours (Ah). Higher Ah = longer runtime. A 2.0Ah battery might last 30-45 minutes on medium duty. A 4.0Ah or 5.0Ah battery can last 60-90 minutes. For large jobs, consider either a high-capacity battery or purchasing a second battery. Also, look for tools with brushless motors—they are more efficient, provide more power, and extend battery life.</p>

    <h3>6. 2-in-1 (Trimmer/Edger) vs. Dedicated</h3>
    <p>Many models offer an edger attachment (either a blade or a wheel-guided edger head). This is highly convenient for maintaining a clean lawn edge without a separate tool. However, dedicated edgers (especially blade-based ones) are often more robust and effective for heavy concrete edging. Assess your primary need.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
