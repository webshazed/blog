            <li class="pros">✅ Powerful copper motor for durability and consistent power.</li>
            <li class="pros">✅ Excellent for detailed finish work (cabinets, trim) thanks to HVLP's lower overspray.</li>

            <li class="cons">❌ Higher operating cost and noise from the compressor.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Our Verdict:</strong> A top-tier HVLP gun for professionals in the automotive refinishing industry.

    <h2>Buying Guide: Key Factors for Commercial Use</h2>
    <p>Selecting the right commercial sprayer hinges on understanding your primary materials and project types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Power Source & Pressure (Airless vs. HVLP/LVLP):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Airless Sprayers (Graco, VEVOR):</strong> Use high hydraulic pressure to atomize paint. <strong>Best for:</strong> Large exterior surfaces (siding, fences, decks), thick coatings (unsanded latex, primers), high-volume production. Pros: Fast, handles thick materials. Cons: More overspray, requires careful masking.</li>
                <li><strong>HVLP/LVLP Spray Guns (InoKraft, ENDOZER, HomeRight):</strong> Use high volume, low pressure air for a soft, controlled spray. <strong>Best for:</strong> Interior finish work (cabinets, trim, furniture), automotive painting, coatings where a flawless finish is critical. Pros: Minimal overspray, excellent finish quality. Cons: Slower coverage on large areas, often require thinning, compressor-dependent models need a separate air compressor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Motor Power & Pump:</strong> For electric airless sprayers, wattage (700W, 750W, 1000W) correlates with power and ability to handle thick paints. A copper motor (like in the #6 model) is a durability upgrade. For compressor-dependent guns, you must match the gun's CFM/PSI requirements to your compressor's output.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Container size (measured in ml or oz) determines how often you stop to refill. For constant commercial work, larger containers (1400ml/47oz+) are preferable. A siphon cup (from bucket) is a major advantage on large jobs.</li>
        <li><strong>Nozzle Tip Size & Materials:</strong> Tip size (e.g., 1.3mm, 1.7mm) determines the material viscosity you can spray and the fan width. Brass nozzles are more durable and provide a finer finish than plastic. Having multiple tips is essential for versatility.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Cleaning:</strong> This is critical for daily commercial use. Look for features like quick-release components, built-in cleaning ports (Powerflush), and inclusion of cleaning tools. HVLP guns with separate air caps and needles require more meticulous cleaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability & Build:</strong> Look for metal gears, robust pump assemblies, and sturdy hose connections.Stand-mounted airless sprayers offer more stability for all-day use than handheld models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The "best" commercial paint sprayer is entirely dependent on your specific workflow. For the general contractor or painting crew handling a mix of interior and exterior projects, an <strong>airless sprayer like the Graco Magnum or VEVOR</strong> is the most practical, high-volume workhorse. If your business focuses on high-end interior finishes, cabinetry, or automotive work, a <strong>precision HVLP/LVLP system (like the InoKraft or ENDOZER)</strong> is non-negotiable for achieving a flawless, professional result. The <strong>high-power HVLP models (#6 and #1)</strong> offer a fantastic compromise, providing more finish control than an airless while handling more material than a standard detail gun.</p>
    <p>Invest in a sprayer that matches the coatings you use most frequently and the scale of your projects. Prioritize durability, ease of maintenance, and nozzle versatility to ensure your tool pays for itself through saved time and superior results on every job.</p>
