        <h2>Buying Guide: How to Choose the Best Metal Band Saw</h2>
        <p>Selecting the right metal band saw depends on your specific workflow and project requirements. Here are the critical factors to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Choose between <strong>cordless (battery-powered)</strong> for ultimate job-site mobility and <strong>corded</strong> for unlimited runtime and often more consistent power. Cordless is best for electricians, plumbers, and field work. Corded is ideal for dedicated shops.</li>
            <li><strong>Cutting Capacity:</strong> This is the maximum thickness of material the saw can handle. Measured in inches (e.g., 3-3/8", 5", 9"). Match this to your typical material. A 5" capacity is a great all-around size for conduits, pipe, and plate. Benchtop saws like the WEN offer larger capacities (9") for big stock.</li>
            <li><strong>Motor & Speed:</strong> Amps (for corded) or voltage (for cordless) indicate power. For metal, look for a motor that can maintain speed under load. <strong>Variable speed</strong> is a valuable feature, allowing you to slow the blade for hard metals (reducing wear) and speed up for softer materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability & Design:</strong> Consider weight, handle design, and balance. Handheld models should be comfortable for prolonged use. Features like integrated hooks (DEWALT) or removable bases (VEVOR) add versatility.</li>
            <li><strong>Blade System:</strong> Ensure the saw accepts standard blade sizes (e.g., 44-7/8" is common for portable saws). Easy blade tensioning and tracking adjustments are a major plus for maintenance and blade life.</li>
            <li><strong>Brand Ecosystem:</strong> If you already own batteries from DEWALT (20V MAX), Milwaukee (M18), etc., sticking with the same brand for your band saw saves money and adds convenience.</li>
            <li><strong>Build Quality & Durability:</strong> Look for all-metal gear housings, sturdy base plates, and protective guards. Professional brands like DEWALT and Milwaukee are engineered for harsh environments.</li>
        </ul>
