<h1>Best Table Saw Under 300 Revied In 2026</h1>

<p>For DIY enthusiasts, carpenters, and hobbyist woodworkers, a reliable table saw is the heart of any workshop. It enables accurate ripping, crosscutting, and beveling, dramatically improving efficiency and finish quality. However, finding a capable table saw on a tight budget—especially under $300—can feel navigating a maze of underpowered, flimsy tools or inflated claims. The good news is that aggressive competition in the power tool market has pushed manufacturers to deliver surprisingly robust features even in entry-level models. Our team rigorously tested and compared dozens of options to identify the true standouts that offer genuine value without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>It's important to note that while the market for dedicated <strong>table saws under $300</strong> is niche, we've expanded our selection to include the most relevant and versatile power saws in this price bracket. This includes top-rated portable job-site table saws and highly capable circular saws that, when used with a guide system, can mimic many table-saw functions. Our curated list prioritizes performance, durability, safety features, and real-world user feedback to help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Detailed Product Reviews</h2>

<h3>DEWALT Table Saw 10 Inch with Foldable Rolling Table Saw Stand (DWE7491RS)</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71O6fCUHLZL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="DEWALT Table Saw 10 Inch" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
<p>DEWALT consistently dominates the professional and homeowner market, and the DWE7491RS is a prime example of why. This isn't just a table saw; it's a complete, portable cutting system. The rolling stand is incredibly sturdy and collapses effortlessly, making transport and storage a breeze. Powered by a 15-amp motor that delivers 4,800 RPM, it has more than enough torque to tackle hardwoods and demanding rip cuts. The 32-1/2-inch rip capacity is generous for a unit in this class, and the telescoping fence rails add versatility. The rack-and-pinion fence is precise and easy to adjust, while the dust collection port does a decent job connecting to a vacuum. For under $300, this offers professional-grade features and legendary DEWALT durability.</p>

<h3>SKIL 15 Amp 10 Inch Portable Jobsite Table Saw with Folding Stand (TS6307-00)</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pTjnqf86L._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="SKIL 15 Amp 10 Inch Portable Jobsite Table Saw" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
<p>The SKIL TS6307-00 is a direct competitor to the DEWALT, aiming at the jobsite professional on a budget. It features a robust 15-amp motor and a 10-inch blade, with a folding stand that’s lighter and more compact than some rivals. The "Quick-Change" blade guard system is a notable convenience. It offers a 24-1/2-inch rip capacity, which is slightly less than the DEWALT but still ample for many projects. The table is made of durable steel, and the base includes storage for accessories. User reviews consistently praise its power for the price and the ease of setting up and breaking down the stand. It’s a no-frills, workhorse table saw that gets the job done reliably.</p>

<p>If your priority is maximum portability and you can work within a slightly smaller rip capacity, the SKIL is an outstanding value and a worthy contender.</p>

<h3>SKIL 15 Amp 7-1/4 Inch Circular Saw with Single Beam Laser Guide (5280-01)</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616jB6IRDPS._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="SKIL 15 Amp 7-1/4 Inch Circular Saw" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
<p>While not a table saw, this circular saw deserves mention for budget-conscious woodworkers. Its killer feature is the integrated single-beam laser guide, which projects a清晰 red line for incredibly accurate cuts—a rarity at this price. The 15-amp motor and 5,300 RPM provide more than enough power for most decking, framing, and sheet-good tasks. The 7-1/4-inch blade size is standard and versatile. The magnesium shoe is durable and flat, crucial for accuracy. Paired with a simple guide rail or even a straight edge, this saw can perform many of the tasks of a table saw for ripping long boards, with the added benefit of being handheld and vastly more portable.</p>

<p>For the ultimate budget workspace, consider this SKIL circular saw alongside a cheap, rigid workbench (like the Worx Pegasus listed below). It’s a flexible and powerful solution for those who can’t yet justify a dedicated table saw.</p>

<h3>Metabo HPT 10-Inch Single Bevel Compound Miter Saw (C10FCG2)</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qU22TCQoL._AC_UL320_.jpg" alt="Metabo HPT 10-Inch Single Bevel Compound Miter Saw" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
<p>A miter saw is not a table saw, but the Metabo HPT (formerly Hitachi) C10FCG2 is such a standout in its category for under $300 that it warrants inclusion. It excels at its core job: making precise angled crosscuts and miters for trim work, framing, and furniture making. The 15-amp motor is smooth and powerful, and the Xact Cut laser guide and shadow line system help you see exactly where the blade will cut. The miter and bevel ranges (0-45° and 0-45° respectively) are generous. Its lightweight design and built-in carry handle make it surprisingly portable for a 10-inch saw. If your primary need is accurate crosscutting and angled cuts, this beats any table saw in this price range for that specific purpose.</p>

<p>Consider this if your projects involve a lot of trim, molding, or precise end-grain cuts. It’s a specialist tool that does one job exceptionally well.</p>

<h3>Skil 5080-01 13-Amp 7-1/4" Circular Saw, Red</h3>

<p>The Skil 5080-01 is a classic, no-nonsense circular saw that has earned its reputation through decades of reliable service. It packs a 13-amp motor and can reach up to 5,300 RPM. The die-cast magnesium shoe is a highlight—it’s rigid, lightweight, and resists warping. It offers 51-degree bevel capacity and a depth-adjustment lever. This model lacks the laserguide of its more expensive sibling (5280-01), but it makes up for it with sheer durability and a lower price. It’s a workhorse tool perfect for framing, decking, and general cutting where laser-precision isn't critical but brute strength and reliability are.</p>

<p>This is a high-quality hand saw, not a power tool. The REXBETI is a vigorous folding saw designed for camping, pruning, and light woodworking. Its 11-inch blade is made from hard-toothed SK-5 steel, which holds an edge well and cuts through green and dry wood aggressively. The folding mechanism is solid and locks securely. The rubberized handle is comfortable and provides a good grip. With over 10,000 positive reviews, it’s a favorite for its sheer utility and packability. In the context of a "best saws under $300" list, it represents the ultimate in portable, zero-cost-of-ownership cutting for small jobs where electricity is impractical.</p>

<h3>RUITOOL Japanese Hand Saw 6 Inch Double Edge Ryoba</h3>

<p>This is a fine example of a Japanese pull saw (Ryoba). The 6-inch double-edged blade features two different tooth configurations: 14 TPI (teeth per inch) for crosscuts and 17 TPI for rips, all on a thin, flexible SK-5 steel blade. The flush-cut capability (when using one side) is perfect for trimming dowels or protrusions without marring the surface. The traditional beech handle is comfortable and provides excellent control. These saws cut on the pull stroke, which allows for a thinner kerf (less material removed) and requires less effort than a Western push saw. It’s a precision instrument for detailed woodworking, model making, and tight spaces.</p>

<h2>Buying Guide: What to Look for in a Budget Table Saw</h2>

<p>When shopping for a table saw under $300, you must prioritize ruthlessly. High-end features like massive cast-iron tables, advanced dado capabilities, or sophisticated riving knives are usually absent. Focus on these critical elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Motor Power & RPM:</strong> Look for at least a 15-amp motor. RPM (revolutions per minute) indicates blade speed; 4,000-5,000 RPM is common and sufficient for clean cuts in most materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Rip Capacity:</strong> This is the maximum width of material you can cut to the right of the blade. A minimum of 24 inches is usable; 30+ inches (like the DEWALT's 32-1/2") offers significant versatility for plywood and wider boards.</li>
  <li><strong>Fence System:</strong> The fence must be rigid, easy to adjust, and stay square. A rack-and-pinion design (found on our top picks) is far superior to cheaper, less accurate fences.</li>
  <li><strong>Portability & Stand:</strong> A folding stand with wheels (like on the DEWALT and SKIL table saws) is a massive upgrade over a stationary base. Consider the weight and folded dimensions for storage and transport.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety Features:</strong> A durable blade guard, a riving knife or splitter (to prevent kickback), and an anti-kickback pawl are non-negotiable. Ensure they are sturdy and easy to re-engage.</li>
  <li><strong>Dust Collection:</strong> While basic, a port that can connect to a shop vac is a huge plus for cleanliness and visibility. Don't expect a sealed system at this price.</li>
  <li><strong>Blade Quality:</strong> The included blade is often mediocre. Budget $30-50 for a good 24-tooth general-purpose or 40-tooth finish blade early on; it makes a dramatic difference in cut quality.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should You Consider a Circular Saw Instead?</strong> If your primary need is ripping long boards and you're extremely space- or budget-constrained, a high-quality circular saw (like the SKIL with laser) paired with a guide track (or a sturdy workbench with a clamp-on guide) can be a viable, ultra-portable alternative. However, for repetitive, accurate, and safe ripping of various widths, a dedicated table saw is always superior.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Finding a capable table saw under $300 is absolutely possible in 2026, with the <strong>DEWALT DWE7491RS</strong> setting the gold standard for its blend of power, portability, and rip capacity. The <strong>SKIL TS6307-00</strong> is a formidable, slightly more portable runner-up. For those whose needs lean toward crosscutting or extreme portability, the <strong>Metabo HPT Miter Saw</strong> and the <strong>SKIL Laser-Guided Circular Saw</strong> are exceptional alternatives that shouldn't be overlooked.</p>

<p>Ultimately, your choice depends on your primary tasks. For general ripping, crosscutting, and beveling of various stock sizes, a true table saw like the DEWALT or SKIL is the wisest investment. For specialized trim work, the miter saw wins. For ultimate on-the-go flexibility, a circular saw with a guide system is a smart, space-saving hack. All the options listed represent the best value in their respective categories for under $300, backed by strong user reviews and reputable brands. Choose the tool that best matches your workshop's needs and most common projects.</p>
