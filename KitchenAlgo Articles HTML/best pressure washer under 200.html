    <p>The ePX3100v is a variant of the above model, trading a slight reduction in max PSI (2100) for an upgraded, detachable foam cannon. This feature is a significant upgrade for car enthusiasts and detailers, allowing for thick, clinging foam that pre-soaks and lifts dirt more effectively. It retains the excellent build quality, steel wand, and 1.76 GPM flow rate. The built-in carry handle enhances portability. With a 4.7-star rating from thousands of reviews, its user satisfaction is exceptionally high.</p>

    <p>The ePX3050 finds a sweet spot between the power of the ePX3100 and the foam-focused ePX3100v. It offers 2100 max PSI and 1.76 GPM, matching the flow rate of its siblings for efficient rinsing.

        <h2>Buying Guide: How to Choose the Best Pressure Washer Under $200</h2>
        <p>When shopping in this budget range, focus on electric models (gas units typically start well above $200). Here are the key factors to consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PSI & GPM:</strong> For light to medium duty (cars, patio furniture, sidewalks), 1500-2000 PSI with 1.2-1.5 GPM is adequate. For more stubborn concrete, siding, or large decks, aim for 2000+ PSI and 1.5+ GPM. We recommend at least 1.2 GPM for effective rinsing.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> All options here are corded electric. Consider cord length and whether you have outdoor outlets. For ultimate portability without a cord, a gas model would be needed, but it will exceed the $200 budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Included Accessories:</strong> A good nozzle set (at least 3-5 tips: 0°, 15°, 25°, 40°, and soap) is crucial. A built-in soap tank or detergent injection system is a major plus for car washing.</li>
            <li><strong>Build Quality & Durability:</strong> Look for steel wands (vs. plastic), sturdy wheels, and a robust frame. Check reviews for mentions of leaks, motor burnout, and overall longevity.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability & Storage:</strong> If space is tight, look for a compact design, carry handle, and integrated wand storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Attachments vs. Full Units:</strong> First, decide if you need a full pressure washer or if an undercarriage cleaner attachment would benefit your existing setup. Attachments are useless without a compatible base unit.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
